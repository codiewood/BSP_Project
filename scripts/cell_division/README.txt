CELL SORTING STILLS:
The file names of the data have the following format:
'[end_time]_div_[seed]_data'
for the monolayer of size = 10 (105 cells), with the additional '_small' indicating data for monolayers of size = 5 (23 cells).

The data files contain cell positions in the first row, and cell types in the second.

FRACTIONAL LENGTH:
The file 'div_1234_sorting_data' contains the average fractional length recorded at each time step of 0.005, up until time 50, across ten simulations, in the first line
and the variances in the second line.
The file 'div_1234_all_simulations' contains the fractional length progression of each individual simulation, with one on each line. Again this value is measured at each time step of 0.005,
up until time = 50.
