Investigations into fractional length evolutions are split into two folders, those investigating 'k_pert' and those investigsting 'lambda'

File names begin with the parameter value used. In the first line of each file, there is the average fractional length, measured at each time step
of 0.005 until time 100 hours, across 10 simulations. The second line contains the variance of the fractional length.

The file '1234_frac_length_data' is as above, for the simulation with default parameters
