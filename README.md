# Part B Structured Project

This project contains all python files, scripts and tests involved in the report 'An Overlapping Spheres Model of Cell-Cell Interaction', produced for the Part B Structured Project in Mathematical Modelling and Scientific Computation, as part of the MMath at Oxford University.

Files
-----
scripts :
	Contains python files and data files for various aspects of the report.
	animations : Animated GIFs of simulations, with various simulation set ups.
	cell_division : Data files and python scripts to produce results in Section 4.
	cell_sorting_measure : Data files and python scripts to produce results in Sections 2 and 3.
	investigate_timestep : Data files and python scripts to produce results in Appendix B.

OS_model :
	Contains python files 'monolayer.py' which contains functions pertaining to the monolayer and simulations, and 'utils.py' which contains
	functions that assist in these simulations but aren't specific to the monolayer properties.
	tests : Contains scripts with unit tests for both files.
